            <h3>Ethical Standard</h3>
            <p>
            In order to preserve the integrity of their work, it is necessary that the authors of original articles provide accurate information regarding their research and an extensive evaluation of its importance. The paper should have all of the details of the references that let others copy the parts. TRR guarantees that research published in a journal is in accordance with ethical standards as well as relevant laws. It involves evaluating informed consent, confidentiality, and other ethical factors.

            <h3>Originality and plagiarism</h3>
            <p>
            Plagiarism refers to using or taking someone else's published or unpublished ideas, original work, or intellectual property without proper permission or attribution. This is done in a way that presents the material as new and authentic rather than acknowledging its existing source. The TRR has a strict policy against copyright infringement, plagiarism, and other publication ethics violations. The TRR is dedicated to safeguarding authors' rights and thoroughly investigates any allegations of plagiarism or misuse of published articles. Similarly, the Editorial Board is responsible for adhering to the journal's editorial standards and procedures, including assuring the publication process is equal, transparent, and timely. The submitted paper of the authors was scanned with software for detecting duplicates.
